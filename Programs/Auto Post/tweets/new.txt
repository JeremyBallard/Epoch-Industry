People fear death when they should fear a life not worth living
Simple minded people think wealth and riches is only of monetary value when in reality I want to be rich in money, knowledge, adventure, health, friendships, and love
When your life gets harder that means you just leveled up
I started alone; I’ve suffered alone; and I’ve built alone. I am not dependent on anybody. The people that are in my life are there because I value them and trust them
No matter the cost. No matter the sacrifice. I will be the strongest member of my bloodline. There is no obstacle high enough. No challenge too tough that will get in my way.  It is inevitable. There is no stopping it
Make peace with your past so it doesn’t disrupt your present 
Pain is inevitable; suffering is optional
A man cannot remake himself without suffering; for he is the marble and the sculptor 
I will win. There is no other choice
When you invest in something, hustle for something and work for something; you have a different type of attachment for that thing. There’s gonna be a cold day in hell before anybody takes that away from you
Either I’m going to get rich; or I’m going to do in the process. If I die; I’ll die what I love doing. If I get rich; me and all of the people close to me in my life will live lives if luxury
The black sheep of the herd usually turns out to be the goat
It’s fuckin Monday; whatever happened last week, happened last week. It is this week and this week I am gonna fuckin make it my bitch
A man who is silent when confronted is a man that has no competition 
I don’t need to believe in a god. I pave my own path; I will define my own destiny
Fight for it
If you want it; earn it
I might die tomorrow. So I’m supposed to save myself? For what? I want to die know that I gave it my all. 
The world is against me; otherwise it wouldn’t be fair
How big would you dream; if you knew you could not fail
You’re more talented than me? I will out work you
I work hard because I can’t fuck up; I am the backup; I don’t have anybody to rely on
The true hell is when the person you are meets the person you could’ve been
It didn’t happen to you; it happened for you
Nothing is impossible to those willing
The mind moves the mass
Be patient and tough, someday this pain will be useful to you
If the wind fails you, use the oars
He conquers who endures
If you want peace, prepare for war
A coward’s mother does to weep
I strive towards higher things
Remember that you must die
No one provokes me with impurity
Mindset is what separates the best from the rest
Talent can get you far; hard work can take you anywhere
If you do what is easy, your life will be hard; but if you do what is hard, your life will be easy
What are you willing to sacrifice in order to gain what you need to prosper
